# Instana Agent

*This is an unofficial package of the Instana agent.*

## Info

This template installs the Instana agent and connects to Instana's SaaS solution.

## Usage

An Instana account and key will be required before installation is successful.

1. Select a host name appropriate to your region.
2. Enter the key provided by Instana for your SaaS environment.  An incorrect key will not stop the agent from starting, but no monitoring data will be received.
3. Optionally create Zone and Tag strings to group and further identify these agents.
4. Host Affinity controls the hosts on which Instana will run.  Being a global service it will run on all hosts in your environment unless this is set and corresponding labels added to hosts.

Goto the [Instana website](https://www.instana.com/) to begin a trial.
